#As of Spring 1.4, hibernate is update to 5.x. In hibernate 5.x the naming strategy is refined and splitted into the 
#implicitNamingStrategy and PhysicalNamingStrategy. Spring implemented the implicitNamingStrategy interface in such a way to obtain 
#ALMOST the same naming used in spring 1.3.x. 
#The configurations below are hibernate specific but we decided to still rely on the spring one which is a light modification of the default hibernate
#implicit strategy. The issues we faced in the update are handled at the db schema with a flyway migration (20170824).

#Flyway changed its default for flyway.table in version 5.0.0 to flyway_schema_history and you are still relying on the old default (schema_version). Set flyway.table=schema_version in your configuration to fix this. This fallback mechanism will be removed in Flyway 6.0.0.
