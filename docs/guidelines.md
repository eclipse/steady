# Development Conventions and Guidelines

To keep the Vulas code readable and maintainable, please follow these rules, even if you find them violated somewhere. Note that this list is not complete. When a file is consistently not following these rules and adhering to the rules would make the code worse, follow the local style.

**TODO: Complete guidelines, see [here](https://github.com/SAP/openui5/blob/master/docs/guidelines.md) for a comprehensive example**
