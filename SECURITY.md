## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security issue, please act responsibly and do NOT report it in the public issue tracker.

Instead, [open a ticket](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=Community&component=Vulnerability+Reports&keywords=security&groups=Security_Advisories) in the Eclipse Bugzilla instance.

More information about Eclipse's vulnerability reporting guidelines can be found in the [Eclipse Project Handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#vulnerability-reporting).

<!--Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.-->
